# EcoTracker
Purpose: The purpose of this Design Document is to outline the development of EcoTrack, a mobile application aimed at promoting environmental consciousness. EcoTrack achieves this by providing real-time tracking of a user’s carbon footprint based on their daily activities, such as driving, energy consumption, and dietary choices. The app calculates the environmental impact of these activities in terms of carbon emissions, giving users a clear understanding of how their actions impact the environment. In addition to tracking, EcoTrack offers personalized insights and recommendations for reducing carbon footprint. This empowers users to take actionable steps towards a more sustainable lifestyle. With the increasing urgency of climate change and the significant role that individual actions play in it, there’s a growing need for tools that help people understand and reduce their environmental impact. By making the abstract concept of a “carbon footprint” tangible and personal. Users can see how specific actions contribute to their carbon emissions, and can understand the direct impact of their lifestyle on the environment.

Goal: The goal of EcoTrack is to make environmental consciousness more accessible and actionable for everyone by providing real-time tracking of a user’s carbon footprint based on their daily activities and offering personalized insights and recommendations for reducing it.
